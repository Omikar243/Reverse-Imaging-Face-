Reverse Image Search (Face)
This project is a Streamlit application that uploads an image to Imgur, then performs a reverse image search (using the SERP API) to find visually similar images. It is especially handy for searching the internet for matches to a face image.

Features
Image Upload:
Upload a .png, .jpg, or .jpeg image from your computer.
Imgur Upload:
Uses the imgurpython library to anonymously upload your image to Imgur, returning a public URL.
Reverse Image Search:
Sends the Imgur URL to the SERP API’s Google Reverse Image Search endpoint to look for visually similar images on the web.
Filtering by Similarity:
Filters out results below a specified similarity threshold (default: 85%).
Requirements
Python 3.7+
Streamlit (for the web interface)
imgurpython (for uploading images to Imgur)
requests (for sending HTTP requests to the SERP API)
You can install these with:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install streamlit imgurpython requests
Setup
1. Obtain API Keys
Imgur Client ID & Client Secret
Register a new application on the Imgur API page.
Copy your Client ID and Client Secret.
The app only needs to perform anonymous uploads, so you won’t necessarily need a full OAuth flow.
SERP API Key
Create an account on SERP API to get your free or paid API key.
2. Configure Your Credentials
In your code (reverse_image.py, for example), locate the following lines:

python
Copy
Edit
SERP_API_KEY = "YOUR_SERP_API_KEY"
IMGUR_CLIENT_ID = "YOUR_IMGUR_CLIENT_ID"
IMGUR_CLIENT_SECRET = "YOUR_IMGUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
Replace the placeholder strings with your real credentials.

3. Check Your File Extension
Make sure your main file is named with a .py extension.
For example: reverse_image.py.

On Windows, if file extensions are hidden, you may need to enable File name extensions in File Explorer’s View tab.
If you see a “missing extension” error when running Streamlit, rename the file to ensure it ends with .py (and not .py.txt).
4. Run the App
Once you have your credentials in place and the file named properly:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run reverse_image.py
Common Issues

If you see an error like Streamlit requires raw Python (.py) files, but the provided file has no extension, rename the file to ensure it ends with .py.
If you see “No module named imgurpython,” install it via pip install imgurpython.
If the SERP API returns an error, ensure your API key is correct and your subscription/usage limits are sufficient.
Usage
Open the Web App
After running streamlit run reverse_image.py, your browser should open automatically at a local address (usually http://localhost:8501).
Upload an Image
Click Browse files (or drag-and-drop) to upload a face image in .png, .jpg, or .jpeg format.
View Uploaded Image
The app displays the uploaded image.
Imgur Upload
The image is then uploaded to Imgur, and the app shows you the public Imgur URL.
Reverse Image Search
The SERP API is called with your image’s URL. If a “best guess” or similar images are found, they’ll be displayed with their similarity scores.
Inspect Raw Results
An expandable section at the bottom shows the full JSON response from the SERP API for debugging or deeper inspection.
